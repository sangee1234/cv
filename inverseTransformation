INVERSE TRANSFORMATION
-It is a basic method for sampliong a psuedo-random number,
-Its used for generating sample numbers at random from any proobability distribution given its function of cumulative distrbution
-It includes the calculation of distribution oof cummulative distribution function, which maps 
 a number to a domain with a porbability between 0 and 1.

 cummulative distributive function(CDF)
 -The cdf of a randdom variable X, evaluated at x is the probability X will take a values <= X
 F(x)=P(X<=x)
 -Eg. for uniform distribution between 0,1
 F(x)=0, x<0
      x, 0>=x>=1
      1, x>1

If X is a continuous random variable with cdf Fx, then random variable Y=F(X) has uniform distribution in [0,1]
Inverse transform is the inverse of this, if Y has a uniform distribution in [0,1] andd X is cdf, F-1 has same distribution as X.

-We want to generate values of X which are dustributed accroding to this distribution

Method:
1.Generate a random number u from unifrom distribution
2.Find the inverse of the desired cdf
3.Compute X=F-1(u)
F(F-1(u)) = u
